# Week 1/Session 1 - Plain and Simple Text

### Extensions
Windows uses extensions such as .exe or .bat to indicate that a file is executable.
extensions are conventions that windows uses to determine how a file is to be handled.

different applications decode binary code in different ways, extensions act as a flag to indicate the type of file and therefore how it should be read (eg, you can tell that a .doc is a document to be opened by MS Word).

### Plain text vs rich text
In the 70's a standard was created ASCII (American Standard for Code Information Interchange) to interpret binary files in a certain way, so binary could be interpreted into characters. It was limited to 127 characters due to hardware limitations of the time.

Due to the limitations of ASCII (particularly with non-american localisation) Unicode was developed. This is still the current standard.
