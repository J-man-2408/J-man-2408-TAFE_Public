# Week 13/Session 14 - Asessemnt
20/5/2025  
[Raf's Lecture materials](https://github.com/NM-TAFE/civ-ipriot-in-class-demos/tree/2025/s1/raf)

No formal class this week. In class time was spent working on the civ-ipriot-smiliey assessment.

## Intro to portfolio assessment
*Provided in Week 12*  
[x] Check assessment doc, then Github.  
[x] Fork then clone repo  
Do stretch goals last  
[x] Docs aren't super important  
[x] don't have to worry about SSH, but could be useful  
Most work is in knowledge and evidence.  
[x] Ignore sense hat warning  
[x] Don't  worry about sense_hat.py - don't use it for question answers.
[x] Short Answers!  
Primitive type is bool, float (not really primative types in python)  
Composite type is list dict etc - things with more than on thing in it
user-defined type is what we call a class.  
A ternary expression is not control flow.  

2.3 look at the sense hat class and methods - don't look at the code.
