## Activity 2: How to Make Toast

**Objective:**  
Learn to write a simple Python program that simulates the steps of making toast, using basic programming concepts such as variables, data types, and operators.  

**Introduction:**  
Brainstorm and discuss the steps involved in making toast.  
*For example:*  
1. Get a slice of bread.
2. Put the bread in the toaster.
3. Set the toaster.
4. Wait for the toast to be ready.
5. Take the toast out.
6. Add toppings (butter, jam, etc.).

**Instructions:**
1. Open IDLE
2. Type a comment at the very top of the page that incudes: your name, student number and name of activity
3. Start by writing a simple print statement to describe each step (use steps in example above).
4. Assign variables: Introduce variables to store the state of the toast and the toaster settings **Example:**  `is_toasted = False`
5. Prompt for user Input: Ask the user for their toaster setting and preferred topping. **Example:**  `topping = input("What topping would you like on your toast? "`
6. Combine the steps into a complete program.

**Task**  
Change the toaster setting to another number  
Run the code to see the output. Does it match the output screenshot below.  

**Example Output**  
```
How many slices of bread do you want to toast? 2
Set the toaster to level (1-5): 3
Get 2 slices of breaad.
Put the bread in the toaster.
Set the toaster to level 3
Wait for the toast to be ready...
Take the toast out.
What topping would you like on your toast? Jam
Add Jam to the toast
```

**Discussion Questions:**  
How important are variable names?  
How do variables and user input make the program more interactive?
