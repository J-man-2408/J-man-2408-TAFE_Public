## Activity 1: String Magic

**Objective:**  
Write a program to perform basic operations on a string.  

**Instructions:**
1. Create a string variable 
2. Ask user to input their name (Enter your name:)
3. Concatenation: Combine the string (user_name) with another string (how are you?)
4. Change Case: Convert the string (user_name) to uppercase.

**Task:**  
Run the code to see the output.

**Example Code:**  
```python
# Ask the user to input their name (string)
type your code here

## Perform string operations

# Concatenation
type your code here
type your code here


# Changing Case
type your code here
type your code here
```

**Example Output:**  

```
Enter your name: Alex
Concatentaion: Hello Alex, how are you?
Uppercase: ALEX
```

**Discussion question:**   
1. What would happen if you removed the spaces in the concatenation line? Try it and observe the result.  
    *There would be no space between the greeting and the username.*
