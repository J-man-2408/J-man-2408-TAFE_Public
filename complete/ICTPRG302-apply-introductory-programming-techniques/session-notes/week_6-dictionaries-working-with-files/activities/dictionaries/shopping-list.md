### Activity 1: Shopping list
**Objective:** Create a dictionary to represent a shopping list, practice adding, accessing, and modifying key-value pairs.  

**Instructions:**  
1. Start by creating a dictionary.
2. Add five grocery items with their quantities (see items and quantities below).
3. Access the quantity of the apple and print it.
4. Update the quantity of an existing item (milk).
5. Remove an item from the dictionary (bananas).
6. Run the Program by combining all the steps into a single program and run it to see how it works.

**Include:**  
* {}
* []
* print()
* apples, Qty: 4
* bananas, Qty: 6
* milk, Qty: 2
* bread, Qty: 1
* eggs, Qty: 12

**Task:**  
Run the code to see the output and test the program by adding and removing different items to see how it behaves. Happy coding! ðŸ˜Š

**Output:**
```
Quantity of apples: 4
Updated quantity of milk: 3
Shopping list after removing bananas: ('apples': 4, 'milk': 3, 'bread': 1 'eggs': 12)
```

**Discussion question:**   
Think of other scenarios where dictionaries could be applied.
