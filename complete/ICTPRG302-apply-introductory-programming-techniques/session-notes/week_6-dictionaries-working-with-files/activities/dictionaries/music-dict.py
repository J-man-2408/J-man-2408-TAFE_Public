# ### Activity 2: Music Dictionary
# **Objective:** Create a dictionary of artists and their popular songs and write a program to interact with this dictionary.

# **Instructions:**
# 1. Start by creating a dictionary.
# 2. Add five musicians and their popular songs.
# 3. Write a function that takes an artist's name as input and prints their popular song.
# 4. Write a function to add a new artist and their song to the dictionary.
# 5. Write a function to remove an artist from the dictionary.
# 6. Write a function to print ALL the artists in the dictionary.

# **Include:**
# * {}
# * []
# * print()
# * def
# * if
# * else

# **Task:**  
# Run the code to see the output and test the program by adding and removing different items to see how it behaves. Happy coding! ðŸ˜Š

### Main
music_dict = inital_dict()

print_music_dict(music_dict)

print_popular_song(music_dict)

add_artist_song(music_dict)

print_music_dict(music_dict)

remove_artist_song(music_dict)

print_music_dict(music_dict)

# **Output:**
# ```
# A popular song by Taylor Swift is: Shake it Off
# Bruno Mars has been added to the dictionary with the song: Uptown Funk
# Drake has beem removed from the dictionary.
# Artists in the Dictionary:
# Taylor Swift
# Ed Sheeran
# Adele
# Billie Eilish
# Bruno Mars
# ```

# **Discussion question:**  
# How would you modify the program to handle multiple popular songs for each artist?
# Make the value for each artist a list instead of a string.
