**Objective:**  
Create a simple treasure hunt game using Python and its file handling techniques.
Instructions:
1. Download the text files named: clue1.txt, clue2.txt, clue3.txt, treasure.txt with clues and directions to find the treasure. Each clue represents a step in the hunt.
2. Write a Python program that reads the clues from the files
3. The player follow the clues to find the treasure
4. Continue until the player finds the treasure
5. Run the Program by combining all the steps into a single program and run it to see how it works.

**Include:**  
* def
* read_clue
* current_clue
* open
* r
* ()
* while
* readline()
* .strip()
* .lower()
* if
* print()
* input()

**Task:**  
Run the code to see the output and test the program by adding and removing different items to see how it behaves. Happy coding! ðŸ˜Š

**Output:**  
```
Clue 1: Look for the next clue in clue2.txt
Enter the next clue file name: clue2.txt
Clue 2: Look for the next clue in clue3.txt
Enter the next clue file name: clue3.txt
Clue 3: Look for the treasure in treasure.txt
Enter the next clue file name: treasure.txt
Congratulations! You've found the treasure!
