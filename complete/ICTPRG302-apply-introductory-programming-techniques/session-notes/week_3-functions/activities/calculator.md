## Activity 1: Build a Simple Calculator
**Objective:**  
Write a program to create a simple calculator that can perform basic addition and subtraction, using functions.  

**Instructions:**  
1. Define functions for addition and subtraction.
2. Create a main function to ask the user for input and call the appropriate function.

**Use the following in your code:**  
* def
* calculator
* ():
* if
* elif
* else

**Task:**  
* Run the code to see the output.

**Example Code:**  
```python
# Function for addition
type code here
    type code here

# Function for subtraction
type code here
    type code here

# Main function
def calculator():
    type code here
    type code here
    type code here

    if type code here
        type code here
    elif type code here
        type code here
    else:
        type code here

# Run the calculator
calculator()
```

**Example Output:**
```
Enter the first number: 3
Enter the second number: 3
Enter operation (+  or -): +
Result: 5.0
```

**Discussion question:**  
1. What would happen if you tried to perform an operation that is not defined in the code (e.g., multiplication)?
