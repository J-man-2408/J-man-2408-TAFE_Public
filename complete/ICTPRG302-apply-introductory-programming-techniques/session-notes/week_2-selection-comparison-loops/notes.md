# Week 2/Session 3 & 4 - Selection Statements, comparison Operators and Loops

## Selection Statements and Comparison Operators
In this session, we are going to learn about Selections statements, comparison operators, if, elif and else statements and the different methods used by programmers to test your code.  

This session will provide you with the skills and knowledge required to:
* 2.2 Create code using language data types, operators and expressions
* 3.1 Apply language syntax in sequence, selection and iteration constructs
* 3.2 Create expressions in selection and iteration constructs using logical operators.


At the end of this session, you should be able to:
* Define, and make decisions in your code using if, elif, and else statements
* Compare values using operators like ==, !=, <, and >
* Apply if, elif, and else statements to control the flow of your programs
* Verify that your code works correctly and fix any errors
* Follow best practices for writing clean and maintainable code
* Identify and resolve issues in your code using debugging tools.


Selection statements are also called conditionals `if` `elif` and `else`, allows a program to choose a different path.  
Lets the program selectively run different parts of code depending on conditions.

These allow the flow of the program to be controlled (control flow)

Block of code is 1 or more lines that are subject to the same control flow.

`if` and `True` are defined keywords

What's switch statements? (not python related).
Look up code coverage tools VS Code has these apparently. for checking goodness of code.

## Loops
In this session, we are going to learn about Python loops and iterations, including for and while loops, and the different methods used by programmers to iterate over data structures.  

**This session will provide you with the skills and knowledge required to:**  
* 2.2 Create code using language data types, operators and expressions
* 3.1 Apply language syntax in sequence, selection and iteration constructs
* 3.2 Create expressions in selection and iteration constructs using logical operators.

**Session 4 Overview**  
At the end of this session, you should be able to:  
* Write and understand loops (for and while), which are fundamental to iteration in Python
* Combine loops with logical operators and control flow statements (if, elif, else), to create functional loops
* Use data types and operators within loops to manipulate and process data effectively.

### Indefinate loops
```py
while <expression>:
    print("Something I do")
    print("Something else")
```
```py
n = 10
while n > 0:
    print("Something I do")
    print("Something else")
```

`continue` and `break` can only be used inside loops

## Comparison Operators
