## Activity 2: Guess the Magic Number
**Objective:**  
Write a program that allows the user to guess a magic number. The program will provide feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.  

**Instructions:**  
1. Define the Magic Number:
   * Choose a magic number (e.g., 7) and store it in a variable.
2. Prompt the User for a Guess:
   * Ask the user to input their guess.
3. Compare the Guess to the Magic Number:
   * Use if, elif, and else statements to compare the user's guess to the magic number.
   * Provide feedback based on the comparison.

**Task:**  
Run the code to see the output.

**Example Output:**  
```
Guess the magic number: 2
Too low! the magic number was 7
```

**Discussion question:**  
1. How do the selection statements (if, elif, else) and comparison operators (==, <, >) help in guiding the user towards guessing the correct number?
