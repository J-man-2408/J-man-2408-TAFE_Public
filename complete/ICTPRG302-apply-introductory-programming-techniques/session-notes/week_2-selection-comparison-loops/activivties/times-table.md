## Activity 1: Learn Your Times Tables

**Objective:**  
Create a program that asks the user for a number and then shows its multiplication table using loops.  

**Instructions:**  
1. Ask the user to input a number (integer). `Use the input()` function in Python to get user input.
2. Use a **for loop** to iterate through numbers 1 to 10.
3. Inside the loop, multiply the user-provided number by the current loop number and print the result.

**Use the following in your code:**
* user_number
* int
* input
* number
* for
* in
* range
* print
* *
* =

**Task:** 
Run the code to see the output.

**Example Code View:**
```python
# Ask the user for a numebr
type your code here # can be one or two lines depending on the code you use.

# Loop to generate the multiplication table
type your code here
    type your code here
```

**Example Output:**
```
Enter a number: 6
6 x 1 = 6
6 x 2 = 12 
6 x 3 = 18 
6 x 4 = 24 
6 x 5 = 30 
6 x 6 = 36 
6 x 7 = 42 
6 x 8 = 48 
6 x 9 = 54 
6 x 10 = 60
```

**Discussion question:**  
Why is a loop useful in programming?
