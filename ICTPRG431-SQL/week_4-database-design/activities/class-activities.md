# Designing Databases 
Portfolio Exercise 
## Brief 
Design the each of the databases listed below:
1. A database to store computers and their specs. (eg, GHz, cores, etc).
2. A database to store foods and their expiry dates for a home. It should also record whether the food has been frozen (in which case the expiry date doesn’t matter). 
3. A shared office space needs a database to record which computing devices (computers, phones and tablets) brought in by the people working there belongs to who. 
4. Create a database that stores in which room of a house various expensive items are kept for insurance purposes. The items could include things like fridges, TVs, washing machines, computers, artwork, furniture... Anything stationary and expensive. 
5. Create a database to store books and their authors. 
6. Create a database to record which movies are being shown at which cinemas in a chain. 
7. Create a database for TAFE. You should include students, lecturers, clusters, units and rooms. This is a more complex database than any previous, so take it slow and consider everything carefully. 

A few notes:
* To make it easy, you don’t have to use the crows feet to denote the many side of a relationship if you don’t want to. Instead, put a “1” on the side of the line which is the one side of the relationship and a “M” on the many side.
* Don’t forget to include a primary key for every table. 
* Consider carefully the relationships between tables. It may help to put the relationship in a sentence and see if it makes sense in English. For example: “A person has one driver’s license and each driver’s license belongs to one person.”
* No many-to-many relationships are allowed. Use join tables. 
* If you create a join table, try to give it a good name where ever possible. 
* Consider carefully what you will need to store in each table. You should have all the information you need and nothing you don’t.
