## Exercise 4 - Times Tables
Write a console application that takes user input from the console and prints out the times tables of the number they input from 0-12. Ensure that only numbers from 0-12 are accepted in the input.  
Example output:  
```
Please enter a number from 1-12:
5
5 x 0 = 0
5 x 1 = 5
5 x 2 = 10
5 x 3 = 15
Etc..
```

## Exercise 5 - Debugging
Debug this code to figure out whatâ€™s causing the code from compiling. HINT: There are FOUR issues. Copy it into VS inside your program.cs file.  
```cs
myFunction();

void myFunction()
{
    //int myInt = 5
    console.WriteLing(myInt);
}
```
1. `console.` -> `Console.`
2. `.WriteLing` -> `.WriteLine`
3. `//int myInt = 5` -> `int myInt = 5`
4. `int myInt = 5` -> `int myInt = 5;`
