# Function Exercises 
 
## Exercise 6 – Declaring and using functions 
Create a welcome message function called `WelcomeMessage()`. When called it will display the 
program’s welcome message. This will call several `Console.WriteLine()` functions to print an opening 
message. E.g.: 
```
******************************** 
Welcome to My Application! 
******************************** 
```

## Exercise 7 – Parameters 
Create a mathematical function that takes two parameters that are numeric types and performs a 
basic arithmetic function on them and prints the result to the console. Try addition and 
multiplication. 

## Exercise 8a – Simple Name 
Update the welcome message function from exercise 6 to include a parameter that allows you to 
pass the name of the user into it and print that along with the function. 
```
******************************** 
Welcome <Your Name>, to My Application! 
******************************** 
```

## Exercise 8b – Complex Info 
Recreate the user information exercise (1 and 2) but this time create a function that takes those 
inputs as parameters. Call the function and pass different values. 
 
Example output: 
```
I am older than them. 
The age difference is 5 Years. 
They have a longer name than I do. 
```

## Exercise 9 – String check for int 
Create a function that takes two parameters, one that is a string, and the other is an int. Check if the string contains the value of the int anywhere in it. Note: There are a few ways to achieve this exercise. One uses string contains, the other can be to loop and check each character. What are the drawbacks of each? 

## Exercise 10 – Return 
Update your exercise 7 functions to return values and remove the print statement from the function itself. Instead, the function will calculate and return the value only. Use the function inside a `Console.WriteLine()` to then print the result like this: 
```sql
Console.WriteLine(Add(4,7)); 
```

The output should look like this: 
```
“4 x 10 = 40” or “5 + 6 = 11” 
```
