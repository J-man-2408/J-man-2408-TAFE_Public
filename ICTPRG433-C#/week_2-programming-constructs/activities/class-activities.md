# Overview
## Exercise 2 - Comparisons
Pair up with a person in the class, message them and swap answers to challenge 1. Store their information in appropriate variables and use these to check your answers against theirs and print the results for the following questions:
* Are you older than them?
* What is the difference in age?
* Find out: Who has the most characters in their name? (How do you get the length of a string?)

Example output:
```
I am older than them.
The age difference is 5 Years.
They have a longer name than I do.
```
**Note:** Remember how we can add strings and variables together using the + operator or $"Use the string {variable} syntax". 

## Exercise 3 - Month/Season Logic
Write a program that asks the user for their birthday month. It should then display the season that the month falls in.  
eg. Input: 8 (or August), Output: Winter  
Use a SWITCH statement for this program.  
**Note:** To get input from the user in the console we store the result of Console.ReadLine() in a string variable. (remember if we want to use this like an int we need to convert between the types)
